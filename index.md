# Discussion 1: Is the Real World Ready for Digital Currencies? - Section B

The world has already accepted the concepts behind digital currencies although not in widespread use. While challenges exist for the commercial and financial sectors, full acceptance and integration into the world economy is inevitable.

Today, a large portion of the world operates as a cashless society using virtual representations of hard currency. Digital currencies in the form of electronic banks and credit cards set the stage through the electronic abstraction of cash[^2]. Even prior to the crypto currencies we now think of as digital currencies, the first centralized digital currency (DigiCash)[^3], although unsuccessful, introduced the concept of digital currency in the late 1980s. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum bring properties like transparency and cryptographic signatures to achieve a distributed trust and consensus without the need for a centralized entity.

Technical complexities of digital currencies often prevent an intuitive understanding of digital currencies. Understanding is made easier through tangible examples. In the social context this is driven through the gaming and the sharing economies. The use of digital currencies for CryptoKitties[^1] and other crypto coins like Enjin Coin and Theta Token[^4] are being used along with virtual tokens in games to intuitively expose the users to digital currencies. In the sharing economy (direct to consumer transportation, consumer goods, and personal services) the properties of crypto currencies enabled through smart contracts provides a huge opportunity for efficiencies[^5][^6]. While not yet widespread, examples include blockchain enabled city services and user to user bike sharing[^1],[^7].

Commercial, financial, and government sectors have begun to see the benefits of digital currencies. There are challenges that must be overcome and are actively being addressed. These challenges include business model threats and regulatory concerns with additional concerns around identity and volatility.

In the commercial and financial space, digital currencies can be a threat to existing business models and will require close management and investment. Examples of threats include the loss of money transfer fees or the UN exploring whether digital currencies can directly replace bank accounts[^8]. Commercial entities like PayPal, Facebook, and WeChat are running trials of digital currencies to provide services traditionally performed by banks[^9].

Regulation is a paramount concern for financial and Government entities across the world. In the United States FinCEN does not consider crypto currencies as legal tender but rather as property, while the SEC considers them securities and the CFTC considers them commodities[^10][^11]. These views are common across the world[^12]. Despite the fractured regulatory space, there is ongoing progress such as Conference of State Bank Supervisors setting standards across the US[^13]. Nations like China and Venezuela are launching their own crypto currencies. Other countries have made attempts to limit cash purchases.[^14][^15]

Identity is another concern since anonymity was a key aspect of the original digital currency implementations. As regulatory frameworks have come into place the anonymous aspects are now being accounted for. While black markets and true anonymity will always exist, widespread acceptance of identity proofing balanced with privacy concerns will be needed for full acceptance worldwide[^15].

While hurdles still exist, these issues are being directly addressed. The tipping point for social, commercial, financial, and Government acceptance already occurred and digital currency will ultimately be fully integrated into society.

# Industries Being Affected by Blockchain Technology - Section B
An interesting use of blockchain is the tracking of trust in the food supply.  IBM established "Food Trust" to track items through out the food supply chain.  This has the potential to track every step in the food production process from where and when an item was grown, who picked it, where/when it was processed, and where/when it was delivered.  In addition to increased visibility for suppliers and distributors in the management of the supply chain, consumers can also scan a QR code and get the same level of fidelity.  In essence, the consumer can trust that an item is truly organic, know how fresh an item is, or if an item was produced humanely.  Another benefit to society includes the management of food recalls in the event E-Coli is discovered. This has the potential to add significant value to everyone in our food supply chain.
